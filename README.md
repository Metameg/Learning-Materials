FOR SNHU CS-210 ASSIGNMENT
===========================

This assignment is not the first time I have used Github, so I will do my best to answer the questions based on what I have posted in this repository so far. 
I created this repository to just kind of keep track of my learning progress since I have begun my journey on learning to code. 

- I will analyze the most recent and final project of this class, the Grocery Tracking Application. This project required the use of both Python and C++ to create an application that had several functions that displayed different representations of data on items that were purchased in a grocery store. The data of the different items was initially given in a text file. 

- I was proud that I was able to get all of the different functionalities required by the project work. These functionalities included printing all of the items purchased with their frequencies to the console, printing a specefic item's frequency given a user's input, and printing a formatted histogram representing the items and their frequencies to the console. 

- I could have enhanced the code by trying to incorporate more pointers and pass by references into the code. This lilkely could have improved the application by speeding up the different functionalities used in the application, which would be important for very large data sets. 

- The parts of the code that were most challenging for me were the parts that had to do with linking the Python and C++ code together. I am not convinced that if starter code for this project was not available that I would have been able to get this step to work on my own. I am planning on using online tutorials to hopefully help me to better understand this process. 

- The use of OOP will definitely be directly tranfesrrable to my future coursework at SNHU, as these principles are the foundations to all higher level programming. 

- The use of comments is always important to developing code that is both readable and adaptable. It is also important to keep code very organized, usually with the use of multiple files, classes, and/or functions as code can get very messy very quickly. It is also important to give meaningful names to variables, functions, classes, files, etc. since again, things can get complicated when trying to decipher someone else's code.

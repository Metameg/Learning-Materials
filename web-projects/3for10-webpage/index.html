		  <h2>Introduction</h2>
			  <p class="block-text">The term '3 for 10' today is used all across the Southwest region of the United States, 
			  however it likely originated somewhere in the metropolitan Houston area. Specefically, Houston's Sharpstown region has been shown to 
			  widely use the 3 for 10 term. Though the  term likely started to reference different forms of drug deals, it has greatly
			  evolved into something much more. Local businesses have begun to integrate the term into their business platforms,
			  effectively brainwashing the people of Houston.
			  <br><br>
			  This has become out of control. Action must be taken.  </p>
			  <h2>The Deals</h2>
			  <p class="block-text">Below are several instances where we see local businesses using the deal to advertise their products. 
			  </p>

			  <p class="block-text">Here we can see a much more aggressive 2 for 10 deal by none other than the inmfamous Burger King:</p><br>
			  <img style="margin-left: 25px" class="image-format" src="images/burgerking2for10.jpg" alt="Burger King's 2 for 10 deal">
			  <br><br>
			  
			  <p class="block-text">As you can see, the deals are exclusively food products at different food chains. Coincidence? HELL NO.
			  The 3 for 10 deal must remain familiar to the people that are most likely to indulge in the deal. That is, people that often
			  eat at fast food chains are the same people that would find a 3 for 10 deal tempting. This deal is just another way of keeping
			  the poor man down, and this deal will continuosly spread unless we stand up against it.</p>
		  
		  <h2>The Movement</h2>
			  <p class="block-text">Dont worry. I have the answer to bring a stop to havok that the 3 for 10 deal is causing in communities
			  such as Sharpstown. We must unite to put a stop to this. </p> 
			  <br>
			  <p class="block-text">I will be holding a series of protests outside several restaurants across the greater Houston area beginning 
			  on <mark>April 20th, 2021</mark>. This date was chosen out of necessity as this day has the highest amount of people visiting these restaurants to
			  partake in the demonic 3 for 10 deal. I hope I am not alone in this fight, and any support is not only appreciated, but needed. I urge you 
			  all to perform your civic duty and join me in the fight. The choice is yours, make the right choice.  </p>

# Learning-Materials
A bunch of random stuff created for different katas, classwork, etc. Essentially just an overall collection of learning projects I've created through various avenues of education.

-----For CS-230 Portfolio Assignment------

The path to my Design Document within this repository is Learning-Materials/schoolwork/Java/GameAuth/CS+230+The+Gaming+Room+Software+Design.pdf

The Gaming Room application is a project that helped me to become familiarized with different design patterns such as the Singleton and Iterator patterns, as well as concepts of the REST API and its functionalities in a program. The program was used to create a design document that explained the different breakdowns of what would be needed to develop this web-based application across multiple different platforms. 

I believe the thing that was most essential for this design document was the chart that explained the pros and cons that each different operating system could have in order to implement the different back-end services that would be required to develop this application.

The techniques I used to design the software in this project included reading through the REST API documentation to help me clear out the FIXME's that were initially attached to the ocde of this application. Not only was this the primary focus as far as writing code for the software in this assignment, but it was the most beneficial art of the assignment for me in terms of progressing my knowledge with different types of software. By having to sift through some of the documentation myself, I was able to become at least somewhat familiarized with how API's are integrated into larger applications such as this one.

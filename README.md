# Learning-Materials
A bunch of random stuff created for different katas, classwork, etc. Essentially just an overall collection of learning projects I've created through various avenues of education.


-----For CS-250 class-------

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

User stories are a vital way for developers to organize their tasks and focus different functionalities of an application at a time. They provide a sort of checklist for the developer. This is an essential part of the agile process since the agile process is so concentrated on doing small 'sprints' of work at a time to develop a final product. By focusing on finishing and completing a list of user stories, the develoer will have a much easier time viewing a project in this spirnt-like mentality.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

For my future projects, it will always be important to remember the agile process as it makes it much easier to get a grasp on what shorter termed tasks need to completed in order to ultimately complete a longer term final project. This type of approach to development has the ability to break an otherwise daunting large-scaled task into many smaller, more manageable tasks that can be completed in a reasonable amount of time.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

when I think of a what a good eam member in the terms of development, I look at characteristics that include someone who is able to stick to a routine schedule and focus on any given tasks at a hand everyday until it is completed, even if some days have a smaller amount of progress than others, the important aspect is a routine that shows effort on a daily basis. This along with someone with good communication skills that can openly and concisely bring up their progress/holdbacks on any given task to other team member's This type of open communication is what every developer needs for the team's routine to remain status quo.
